# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor
Single-Cycle MIPS Processor is a digital design project focused on the implementation of a MIPS processor in a single clock cycle using Verilog. This project provides a clear, practical example of MIPS architecture and serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental processor design principles.
